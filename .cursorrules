# CSV2Notion Neo - Cursor Rules

## Project Context

This is CSV2Notion Neo, an advanced command-line tool for uploading and merging CSV or JSON files with images to Notion databases. The project is written in Python 3.9+ and uses Poetry for dependency management.

## Version 2.0.0+ Migration

CSV2Notion Neo has been fully migrated to use the official [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) and the [notion-sdk-py](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py) library. This migration provides better reliability, security, and future compatibility. The application now uses Notion integration tokens instead of session cookies and requires database URLs to be provided for all operations.

### Migration Implementation Details

#### New File Structure
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_client.py`: Notion API client wrapper with comprehensive retry logic
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_db.py`: Database operations with enhanced schema detection and thread-safe select option management
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_row_upload_file.py`: File upload operations with retry logic
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_db_client.py`: Extended client with additional functionality

#### Removed Components
- `csv2notion_neo/notion/` directory: Legacy API implementation
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_row.py`: Old row handling classes
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_db_collection.py`: Old collection management
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_client_official.py`: Renamed to `notion_client.py`
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_db_official.py`: Renamed to `notion_db.py`
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_row_upload_file_official.py`: Renamed to `notion_row_upload_file.py`
- `csv2notion_neo/notion_db_client_official.py`: Renamed to `notion_db_client.py`

#### Key Implementation Changes
- Authentication: Integration tokens instead of session cookies
- Database Operations: Notion databases API endpoints with page URL support for creating databases within existing pages
- File Uploads: Notion file_uploads API endpoints with comprehensive retry logic
- Error Handling: Notion API error codes and responses with smart retry strategies
- Rate Limiting: Built-in API rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Property Validation: API property type validation with intelligent schema detection
- Thread Safety: Thread-safe select option management to prevent race conditions during concurrent uploads
- Retry Logic: Enhanced retry system with 15 attempts, exponential backoff, and jitter for production reliability
- Logic Path Separation: Clear distinction between creating new databases in pages vs uploading to existing databases

#### Compatibility Layer
- Maintains existing method signatures where possible
- Provides seamless transition from old to new API
- Handles data structure differences between APIs
- Preserves all existing functionality and features
