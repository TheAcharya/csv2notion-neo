# Contributing to CSV2Notion Neo
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Using Github's Tools
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Github Flow
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
