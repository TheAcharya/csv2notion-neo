An alternative way to import `*.csv` files to [Notion.so](https://notion.so).

Due to current limitations of the official Notion SDK this tool is using the unofficial SDK by **Jamie Alexandre** [notion-py](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py).

Original idea belongs to [Vigneswaran Rajkumar](https://vigneswaranrajkumar.com/).

### Advantages over native import

- Actually merge CSV with existing database rows (not just add new ones), first column will be used as a key
- Manually set column types instead of relying on autodetection
- Automatically link or create new entries in relation columns based on their value
- Upload files into "Files & media" column
- Set icon for each row
- Set cover or embed image for each row
- Upload image file used for cover or icon
- Options for validation of input data

### Disadvantages over native import

- Slower speed, since every row is imported separately
  - this is mitigated by multithreaded upload

## Installation

### Using portable binary

[**Download the latest binary release**](https://github.com/vzhd1701/csv2notion/releases/latest) for your OS.

### With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Recommended for macOS)

```bash
$ brew install vzhd1701/tap/csv2notion
```

```

### Input

You must pass a single `*.csv` file for upload. The CSV file must contain at least 2 rows. The first row will be used as a header.

Optionally you can provide a URL to an existing Notion database with the `--url` option; if not provided, the tool will create a new database named after the CSV file. The URL must link [to a database view](https://github.com/vzhd1701/csv2notion/raw/master/examples/db_link.png), not a page.

The tool also requires you to provide a `token_v2` cookie for the Notion website through `--token` option. For information on how to get it, see [this article](https://vzhd1701.notion.site/Find-Your-Notion-Token-5f57951434c1414d84ac72f88226eede).

**Important notice**. `token_v2` cookie provides complete access to your Notion account. Handle it with caution.

### Upload speed

Due to API limitations, the upload is performed one row at a time. To speed things up, this tool uses multiple parallel threads. Use the `--max-threads` option to control how fast it will go. Try not to set it too high to avoid rate limiting by the Notion server.

### Duplicate CSV columns

Notion does not allow the database to have multiple columns with the same name. Therefore CSV columns will be treated as unique. Only the **last** column will be used if CSV has multiple columns with the same name. If you want the program to stop if it finds duplicate columns, use the `--fail-on-duplicate-csv-columns` flag.

### Missing columns

If a CSV file has columns absent from Notion DB, they will be ignored by default. Use the `--add-missing-columns` flag if you want the tool to add missing columns into Notion DB. Use the `--fail-on-missing-columns` flag if you want the program to stop if it finds a column mismatch.

### Column types

By default, the tool will try to guess column types based on their content. Alternatively, you can provide a comma-separated list of column types with the `--column-types` option when creating a new database or adding new columns with the `--add-missing-columns` flag. Since the first column in Notion DB is always text, the tool will use the list to set types for the rest of the columns.

By default, new options for `select` and `multi_select` columns are added with default (gray) color. If you want the tool to randomize colors for new options, use the `--randomize-select-colors` flag.

Some column types do not support assigning value to them because the database generates their content automatically. Currently these types include `created_by`, `last_edited_by`, `rollup` and `formula`. If you want the program to stop if it finds such columns in the database, use the `--fail-on-unsettable-columns` flag.

If the tool cannot convert the column value type properly, it will replace it with an empty string. If you want to make sure all values are correctly converted, use the `--fail-on-conversion-error` flag, which will stop execution in case of a conversion error.

The table below describes available codes for `--column-types` and what values are supported by each column type:

### Merging

By default, the tool will add rows to the existing Notion DB. To merge CSV rows with the Notion database, use the `--merge` flag. The first column of CSV and Notion DB will be used as a key to update existing rows with new values. CSV rows that didn't have a match in Notion DB will be added as new.

Since the tool treats rows as unique during merge based on the key column, it will use first found rows with a unique key. To avoid this ambiguity, you might want to validate duplicate row keys with the `--fail-on-duplicates` flag. It will check both CSV and target Notion DB before the merge.

If you want only select columns to be updated, use the `--merge-only-column` option.

If you don't want the tool to add any new rows not already present in the Notion DB during merge, use the `--merge-skip-new` flag.

### Relation columns

Notion database has a `relation` column type, which allows you to link together entries from different databases. The tool will try to match column data with keys from a linked database.

By default, it will match with the first found row; it will add nothing if it cannot find the match. Use the `--add-missing-relations` flag if you want the tool to create new entries in the linked DB if no match is found. Use the `--fail-on-conversion-error` flag if you want the program to stop if no match is found.

You can also use Notion URLs in columns of this type, and they must belong to the linked DB. The tool will not be able to add missing entries for URLs if you use the `--add-missing-columns` flag.

Since the tool treats rows in the linked DB as unique you can prevent ambiguous matching with the `--fail-on-relation-duplicates` flag. It will check linked DB for duplicate keys and stop the executions if it finds any.

If linked DB is not accessible (linked DB is deleted or your account doesn't have access to it), columns that point to it will be ignored. If you prefer the program to stop in this case, use the `--fail-on-inaccessible-relations` flag.

### Cover image / Embedded image

The tool allows you to add an image to each row with the `--image-column` option. It will use one column from CSV as a data source for the image. It can be either a URL or a file name. The file name must be either an absolute path or a path relative to the CSV file. The tool will upload the file to the Notion server.

By default, the tool will embed an image inside the row page. If you want it to use the image as a page cover, then set the `--image-column-mode` option to `cover`.

Column specified with the `--image-column` option will not be treated as a regular column by default. If you want it to appear in Notion DB, use the `--image-column-keep` flag.

To add custom caption to image block uploaded with `--image-column-mode` set to `block`, use `--image-caption-column` option. To also keep the caption as a Notion DB column, use `--image-caption-column-keep` flag.

### Icon

The tool allows you to add an icon to each row with the `--icon-column` option. The behavior is the same as with `--image-column`; the only difference is that you can use URL, file name, or single emoji.

To also treat `--icon-column` as a regular column, use `--icon-column-keep` flag, similar to `--image-column-keep`.

If you want to set the same icon for each row, use the `--default-icon` option. If both `--icon-column` and `--default-icon` are present, the default icon is used if the row doesn't have anything in the icon column.

### Mandatory columns

If you want to ensure that specific columns always have value and are not allowed to be empty, then use the `--mandatory-column` option. The program execution will stop if validation fails.
